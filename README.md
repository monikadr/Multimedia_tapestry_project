# image-tapestry

Final project for a course on Multimedia Systems Design at the University of Southern California (Fall 2017). The idea is to extract important keyframes from a given video file in an RGB format and sync with the audio provided in a WAV format. The project also introduces the concept of an image tapestry to present the highlights of the video.


This program requires OPENCV to be installed and common-lang3 jar to be added.
Also 4 additional empty folders are needed 1. keyframes, 2. foreground 3. resources 4. seamcarve
